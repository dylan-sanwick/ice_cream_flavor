###  1. Identify one problem you encountered in this unit (i.e., during the independent project, not before) and describe how you overcame it. This might be fixing a bug, implementing a feature, or understanding a new concept or skill. Include a code snippet along with your explanation.

#####  - One problem was making my code more unqiue. My initial plan contains mainly inputs and boolean expressions, adding more stuff to make it more complicated and worth a final project took many steps  to learn.

###  2. How has your understanding of computing changed since the beginning of the semester? Identify at least one specific piece of knowledge, concept, or attitude.

#####  -  On specific piece of knowledge is the ability to undestand formatting in different code languages, each language has reltivley similar methods od coding and variables, however, there it does vary from time to time. When i ran into problems, most times it was due to a mistake i made. Incorperating github and vs code shortcuts to python, which once i fixed untimatly wasnt a problem, but would also fix future problems

###  3. What new skills have you acquired this semester? Identify at least one thing you can do now that you could not do before taking the class.

#####  - I have aquired more independence through learning new things. Since you were very hands off, it made all the decisons up to us. Since you trusted us with that, i went on my own to learn a new language

###  4. In what ways do computers improve our lives? Explain.

#####  - I think that without a doubt they provide entertainment, but also are a part of everyday life. They do stuff and calculations that we dont even realise, almost every aspect of modern life depends on the functionality of these comoputers, communnication, production, and just monitoring certain things in life

###  5. In what ways would our lives be improved by removing computers from our lives? Explain

#####  - A possibility of more peace and prosperity, relying mostley on natrual resources and could cuase society to return back into a more native state, it would also limit travel and makes certain means of communication

###  6. Will being in this class have an impact on you in the future? In what way?

#####  - It is a prerequiset to APSCP and will also help me become more independent in learning on my own
